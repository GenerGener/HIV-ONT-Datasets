# HIV-ONT-Datasets
Practice dataset for native RNA sequencing and assembly. This information was made available for the [COVID-19 Biohackathon April 5-11 2020](https://github.com/virtual-biohackathons/covid-19-bh20)

##Background



##Method

Genomic DNA from one (n=1) Tg26 male mouse (Dickie, et al. 1991) was extracted from the bone marrow with special consideration for maintaining longer gDNA. Longrange PCR was performed to create ~6 kb amplicons. DNA was sequence on one MinION (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, Oxford, UK), with SQK-LSK109 accroding to manufacturer's protocol. Live basecalling with MinKNOW verion 19.12.5 was done on High-accuracy mode. Read filtering was done in Galaxy, specifying reads between 5.5 and 6 kb.
